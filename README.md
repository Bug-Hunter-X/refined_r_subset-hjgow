This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in R when subsetting data frames using multiple logical conditions. The `bug.R` file contains code that incorrectly subsets a data frame, while `bugSolution.R` provides the corrected version. The error arises from a misunderstanding of how R evaluates logical operators, specifically when using '&' (AND) and '|' (OR) in a combined condition.  The solution highlights the importance of properly using parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations.
